# Social-Project
A simple but functional full stack social media web app. Modified from [Colt Steele's](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/) famous 'YelpCamp' project, as taught on his [web development bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on Udemy.

Expanded upon the original project by creating routes/backend infrastructure for updating and deleting user profiles.

Deployed via Heroku @ [https://agile-hamlet-54787.herokuapp.com/posts](https://agile-hamlet-54787.herokuapp.com/)
